# AWS_ec2_based_web_page
### This project is a detailed instruction of how you can a host your personal web site for cheapest price in 2023-2024.

# For my project I'll be use folowing steck of technology:
* AWS ec2 with ubuntu operating system
* ElasticIPs - statick ip which won't be changed after enstanse reboot
* Docker
* NGINX web server which will be run in docker. It allow me for creating isolated and encapsulated components that don't share resources that allow us automatically scale them up or down in future.
* www.namecheap.com for domain registration
* www.cloudflare.com for encrypting my web traffic, preventing data theft and other tampering.
* And of course HTML & CSS files, for web page itself. That I found in internet and customized to myself.
